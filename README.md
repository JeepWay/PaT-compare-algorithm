# The algorithms compared with [PaT](https://github.com/JeepWay/PaT)

## Installation
Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/JeepWay/PaT?tab=readme-ov-file#2-installation) in the [PaT](https://github.com/JeepWay/PaT) to install the necessary dependencies.

## Algorithms
1. Shelf Next Fit
2. Shelf First Fit
3. Skyline Bottom-Left
4. Zhao-2D
5. Deep-Pack
6. Zhao-2D with Truth Mask
7. Deep-Pack with Truth Mask

## Usage example
If you want run deep-pack, please moving to the deep-pack directory.
```bash
cd deep-pack
```
Run the following command to start the deep-pack training and testing:
```bash
python main.py --config_path settings/v1_deeppack_DDQN-h200-rC.yaml
```

Like Pat, the complete commands for all experiments in the thesis are included in the `scripts/all.sh` script under each algorithm directory.

For example, the path to  `scripts/all.sh` for deep-pack is [deep-pack/scripts/all.sh](deep-pack/scripts/all.sh).
